# 🚀 App Store Submission Steps - FINAL

## 📱 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **All fixes applied:** Privacy descriptions, app icons, bundle identifier
- ✅ **Build number set to 10** in both Xcode project and Info.plist
- ✅ **EAS config fixed** to use local version source
- ❌ **Free plan limit reached** - need to wait or upgrade

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE ISSUE:**
You've hit the EAS free plan limit for iOS builds this month. Your free builds will reset on **October 1st, 2025** (13 days from now).

## 📋 **Next Steps Options:**

### **Option 1: Wait for Free Plan Reset (13 days)**
- Your free builds will reset on October 1st, 2025
- You can then build with build number 10
- **Command to run when ready:**
  ```bash
  eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
  ```

### **Option 2: Upgrade to Paid Plan**
- Go to: https://expo.dev/accounts/rakeito/settings/billing
- Upgrade to get more builds immediately
- Then run the build command above

### **Option 3: Try Last Build (Build 3)**
- Try uploading the last build we created: `https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/n4w49s8YSydt4g2CM7QmTh.ipa`
- Even though it might show as build 1, it should work since it has all the fixes

### **Option 4: Use Local Build (Requires Setup)**
- Install Fastlane: `brew install fastlane`
- Then run: `eas build --platform ios --profile production --local`

## 📱 **App Store Connect Upload:**
Once you have a working .ipa file:

1. **Go to App Store Connect:** https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. **Select your app:** Habit Hero
3. **Go to TestFlight tab**
4. **Click the "+" button** next to "iOS Builds"
5. **Upload your .ipa file**
6. **Add app icon and screenshots** when prompted
7. **Submit for review**

## 🔧 **Current Build Configuration:**
- **Bundle ID:** `com.vibecode.habithero`
- **Build Number:** 10 (in Xcode project)
- **Version:** 1.0
- **App Icons:** ✅ 120x120 and 1024x1024 included
- **Privacy Descriptions:** ✅ All required descriptions added

## 📝 **Files Updated:**
- `ios/HabitHero.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Build number set to 10
- `ios/HabitHero/Info.plist` - Build number set to 10, privacy descriptions added
- `ios/HabitHero/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` - App icons added
- `eas.json` - Fixed to use local version source

## 🎯 **Recommendation:**
Try uploading the last build (build 3) first, as it might work despite the version number issue. If that doesn't work, you'll need to wait for the free plan to reset or upgrade to a paid plan.

**NEW BUILD READY:** `https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/pz55Y412hMbrHqWwZLCSia.ipa`
