# Splash Screen Fix Progress

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Show only a black splash screen with app icon and "Building Better Habits" text for 3 seconds before opening the main app.

## ✅ Completed Fixes:

### 1. App Configuration (app.json)
- ✅ Set global `backgroundColor: "#000000"`
- ✅ Set iOS-specific `backgroundColor: "#000000"`
- ✅ Set `userInterfaceStyle: "dark"`
- ✅ Removed splash image from native configuration to prevent white flash
- ✅ Added `expo-splash-screen` plugin configuration

### 2. App Initialization (App.tsx)
- ✅ Added `SplashScreenExpo.preventAutoHideAsync()` at top
- ✅ Added `SplashScreenExpo.hideAsync()` immediately to prevent white flash
- ✅ Implemented 3-second timer for splash screen display
- ✅ Fixed React Hooks order issue
- ✅ Added proper state management for splash screen timing

### 3. Splash Screen Component (src/components/SplashScreen.tsx)
- ✅ Forced black background (`#000000`)
- ✅ Forced white text for app name and slogan
- ✅ Added fallback text logo ("H") if image fails to load
- ✅ Simplified image loading logic
- ✅ Added proper error handling

## 🔄 Current Issues:

### 1. App Logo Not Displaying
- **Problem**: Splash screen shows blank black square instead of app icon
- **Status**: Pending fix
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Check if `app-logo.png` exists and is accessible
  - Verify image path and require() statement
  - Test fallback text logo display

### 2. White Flash Still Occurring
- **Problem**: User reports still seeing white splash screen first, then black
- **Status**: Partially fixed but needs verification
- **Next Steps**:
  - Test current configuration
  - May need additional native splash screen configuration

## 🎯 Next Session Goals:

1. **Fix App Logo Display**
   - Verify `assets/app-logo.png` exists
   - Test image loading in splash screen
   - Ensure fallback text logo works

2. **Test Complete Splash Screen Flow**
   - Verify only black splash screen appears
   - Confirm 3-second duration
   - Test smooth transition to main app

3. **Final Verification**
   - No white flash
   - Black background with app icon
   - "Building Better Habits" text visible
   - 3-second display duration

## 📁 Key Files Modified:

- `app.json` - Native splash screen configuration
- `App.tsx` - App initialization and splash screen timing
- `src/components/SplashScreen.tsx` - Splash screen UI component

## 🚀 Ready for App Store Submission:

Once splash screen is fixed, the app should be ready for App Store submission with:
- ✅ Payment integration complete
- ✅ Backend API deployed
- ✅ Pro features implemented
- 🔄 Splash screen (final fix needed)

## 💡 Quick Start for Next Session:

1. Run `npx expo start --ios`
2. Test splash screen display
3. Fix logo display issue
4. Verify 3-second timing
5. Test complete app flow
